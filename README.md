Part A: Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights<br>
Part B: Customer Churn Prediction<br>

## Part A: Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights
### Overview<br>
 Airbnb provides a platform for property owners to rent out their spaces to travelers. Pricing a
 listing effectively is critical for maximizing revenue while staying competitive in the market.
 For hosts, understanding what factors influence the price of their listings is essential.<br>
 This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings
 based on various features such as property type, room type, location, amenities and host
 characteristics. By analyzing these factors, this project will provide actionable insights to
 Airbnb hosts to optimize their listing prices.<br>
### Problem Statement<br>
 The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts the price
 of an Airbnb listing. Using features such as property type, room type, number of reviews,
 location, and amenities, the model will aim to estimate the price accurately.<br>
 The insights derived from this analysis will help Airbnb hosts understand the key drivers of
 price, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for pricing their properties. Additionally,
 the project will help Airbnb refine its recommendations for pricing to improve host and guest
 satisfaction.<br>
 
## Part B: Customer Churn Prediction
### Overview<br>
 Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when a customer ceases their relationship
 with a company or service provider. In today's highly competitive business environment,
 retaining customers is a critical factor for long-term success. Predicting customer churn can
 help organizations take proactive steps to retain customers, thus minimizing revenue loss.<br>
 This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will
 churn based on their demographic, account, and service-related data.<br>
### Problem Statement<br>
 The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a customer
 will churn. Using demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), along
 with information about the services they use (such as internet service, phone service, and
 online security), we will attempt to build a model that helps the company identify customers
 who are at a high risk of churning.<br>
 By predicting customer churn, the company can proactively design retention strategies to
 keep these customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial loss.<br>
